== Feature ==

1.) This plugin(Auth Server) basically copy user info from remote server database to client server database.
2.) This plugin will not work individual you need to install our other plugin (Plugin :Auth Client) to your client server.
3.) Using Generate Token we can add multiple website url using "Add Site".



for example :you added site :http://localhost/user it generate a auth key like 207992f6377433e860064f22deb7a731

This auth key, you have to add to client server(for ex :http://localhost/user) so that userinfo can be shared between both remote server (for ex:http://localhost/latestwp) and client server(http://localhost/user)

This plugin(Auth Server) will not work individual you need to activate other plugin(Client Server) at client side
